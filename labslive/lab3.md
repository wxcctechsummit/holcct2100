# Introduction

## Lab Objective

- This lab is designed to ensure you are able to configure a voice contact end to end and receive it on the agent desktop.

## Part 1: Setup a Simple Flow and make a test call

### 1. Configure and Publish the first flow
- Create a new flow `MyFirstFlow_<podId>` where PodId is your unique pod number.
- Add play message step and configure it with `0_welcome.wav` prompt. 
- Finish the flow with EndFlow block.
- Verify and publish the flow.

### 2. Create an inbound Voice Entry Point and map a DN

- On the Portal create an inbound voice entry point `EP_voice_<podId>` (Provisioning > Entry Point)
- Map the external number on the Entry Point Mappings page. (Proivisioning > Entry Point Mappings). Map the DN to `EP_voice_<podId>`. The DN is already added on Control Hub.

### 3. Configure the Entry Point Routing Strategy

- Configure the Open 24x7 routing strategy time of day on the Entry Point Routing strategy by selecting it on the Routing Strategies > `EP_voice_<podId>`.
- Map the flow `MyFirstFlow_<podId>`.

### 4. Make a test call
- Login to the agent desktop into `Team_wxcclab` and go to a ready state. Login agent WebEx Calling application.
- Login to the supervisor WebEx Calling app on your mobile.
- From supervisor's WebEx Calling app, dial the number you associated with EP. You should hear the welcome prompt and then silence.

**Good to Know!**: The call is not dropped, as we use EndFlow block which finishes the flow but does not disconnect the call.

- Modify `MyFirstFlow_<podId>` and replace EndFlow with Disconnect node from CallHandling section. Publish the flow.
- Place a test call again. The call should be disconnected after the welcome prompt.

- Download new prompts:
   - [Welcome.wav](https://ayankovs-ccp-s3.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/wcclab_prompts/Welcome.wav){:target="_blank"}
   - [2OptionMenu.wav](https://ayankovs-ccp-s3.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/wcclab_prompts/2OptionMenu.wav){:target="_blank"}
   - [QueueMusic.wav](https://ayankovs-ccp-s3.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/wcclab_prompts/QueueMusic.wav){:target="_blank"}

- Upload audio files to WebEx Contact Center.
  Go to  Routing Strategy (from Portal) > Resources > Audio Files. 
  (Browse > New > Upload the files)

### 2. Create Queue

- Create a voice queue `Q_voice_<podId>`. (Provisioning > Entry Point / Queue > Queue). 
- In Queue Call Distribution assign agent team `Team_wxcclab` to the Queue. Your Agent will then login to that team to get the call.

### 3. Add Menu and Queue treatment to the flow
- Modify `MyFirstFlow_<podId>`:
  - replace a welcome prompt to the new one `Welcome.wav`
  - add Menu step with prompt `2OptionMenu.wav` and configure two options
  - add Queue Contact step and configure it with queue `Q_voice_<podId>`
- Configure the play music to loop, and start 0, end 120 to play 2 minutes of music.
- Verify and publish the flow.

### 4. Make a test call
- Login to the agent desktop into `Team_wxcclab` and go to a ready state.
- Dial the number using your cell. You should hear the welcome prompt and get the call on the agent desktop.
